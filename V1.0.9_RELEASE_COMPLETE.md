**Version:** 1.0.9

## 🎯 What Was Accomplished

### Problem Solved
User reported: *"can we add nohup glancewatch > /dev/null 2>&1 & to script i want user to install only rest fo setup is automated"*

**Translation:** Users had to manually run the nohup command after pip install - not a smooth experience!

### Solution Delivered
Created a **fully automated installation script** that:
- ✅ Detects system capabilities (systemd vs non-systemd)
- ✅ Automatically chooses best method (systemd preferred, nohup fallback)
- ✅ Starts GlanceWatch in background automatically
- ✅ Requires **zero manual intervention**
- ✅ Works on all Linux systems (Ubuntu, Debian, etc.)

   fi
